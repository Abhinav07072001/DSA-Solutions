Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 47.24%Submissions: 181K+Points: 1
Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the popped element)

We just have to implement the functions push and pop and the driver code will handle the output. 

Solution : class MyQueue {

    int front, rear;
	int arr[] = new int[100005];

    MyQueue()
	{
		front=0;
		rear=0;
	}
	
	//Function to push an element x in a queue.
	void push(int x)
	{
	    // Your code here
	} 

    //Function to pop an element from queue and return that element.
	int pop()
	{
		// Your code here
	} 
}

Time Complexity of push and pop operation is o(1)
